# Nunix config files

Finally saving and versioning my config files.
The title should be self-explanatory, but here is the listing:

File | Description
--- | ---
.bashrc | Bash user config file, targeted mainly at Aeon and Distrobox
nunix.zsh-theme | ZSH theme file. Based on Agnoster theme
dbox-apps.ini | List of distrobox applications
